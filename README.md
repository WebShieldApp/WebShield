# WebShield - Safari Adblocker

### Introduction

WebShield is a wide-spectrum content blocker, akin to uBlock Origin, specifically for Safari.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Note:** WebShield is currently in a beta stage of maturity. Features and documentation are subject to change as we continue to develop and improve the project.

## Features

WebShield can block ads, trackers, cookie notices, and more. You can also import custom filter lists. WebShield supports Safari's Content Blocking API as well as scriptlets & extended css for more advanced, targeted blocking.

## System Requirements

These requirements are tentative and due to change. I will try to support older OSes as much as I can.
- macOS 15 or later
- iOS 18 or later
- visionOS 2 or later

## Installation

### App Store (Coming Soon)

1. Download and install WebShield from the [App Store](https://example.com) (Coming Soon).
2. Open Safari and navigate to **Preferences** > **Extensions**.
3. Enable WebShield and its content blockers.

### From Source (Coming Soon)

For developers and advanced users who want to build from source:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/WebShieldApp/WebShield.git
   ```
2. Open the project in Xcode and build the app for your platform.
3. Follow platform-specific steps for enabling the extension in Safari.

*Note: Detailed installation instructions will be added once the project reaches a stable release.*

## Acknowledgments

WebShield draws inspiration from privacy and performance-focused projects like uBlock Origin. This project wouldn't be possible without the dedication of filter list maintainers who work tirelessly to keep the web clean. I'm deeply grateful to stand on the shoulders of these projects and their contributors. Special thanks to AdGuard, whose tools‚Äîparticularly SafariConverterLib and Scriptlets/ExtendedCSS‚Äîhave been instrumental to WebShield's development. I'd also like to thank @0xCube for our ongoing collaboration and the valuable connection between our projects.

WebShield is and will always remain free, with all core ad-blocking functionality available to everyone. We believe in keeping the web clean and accessible, without hiding essential features behind paywalls.

As an independent, self-funded project, WebShield relies exclusively on user donations to sustain its development. This funding model is intentional‚Äîit ensures our incentives align perfectly with our users' interests. By choosing this path over revenue from ads, tracking, or deals with ad companies, we maintain our independence and stay true to our privacy-first principles.

WebShield+ offers a tiered support system: the more you contribute, the greater your influence on WebShield's future development. Your level of support directly correlates with the weight your voice carries in shaping our roadmap and future features.

For a modest contribution (starting at $1 either monthly or as a one-time payment), WebShield+ offers:
* Early access to release candidate versions and experimental features
* Direct communication with the development team
* Influence on WebShield's roadmap (scaled with contribution level)
* A special badge on Discord
* The satisfaction of supporting a truly independent ad-blocker

I develop WebShield as a full-time student, dedicating and paying with my free time to create the best possible ad-blocking experience for Safari users. While supporting the project is entirely optional, every donation directly funds our continued development and independence. This user-supported model allows us to maintain our unwavering focus on privacy and performance, free from the compromises that come with alternative funding sources.

Our commitment to providing a powerful, free ad-blocker for all Safari users remains unchanged. We believe in creating a product valuable enough that users choose to support it, rather than forcing their hand through paywalls or compromising with "acceptable ads."

Together, we can redefine ad-blocking for Safari, prioritizing user privacy, performance, and a cleaner web experience for everyone.
