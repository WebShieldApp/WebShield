# Issue Reporting Guidelines

Thank you for using WebShield! Before submitting an issue, please take a moment to read through these guidelines to ensure that your report is actionable and helps us improve the project efficiently.

## Types of Issues to Report

### **Bug Reports**
We handle issues related to WebShield itself (e.g., performance, incorrect rule application, crashes) but **do not maintain filter lists**. If you are experiencing problems with specific websites (ads not being blocked or incorrect blocking), the issue might lie with the **filter list**, and you should report it to the respective filter list maintainer (e.g., [EasyList](https://easylist.to)). Ensure that the only extension being used is WebShield, and you are using Safari **not** Safari TP.

Examples of WebShield-related bugs:
- WebShield crashes or causes Safari to slow down.
- Filter rules are not being applied properly (e.g., syntax errors or rule implementation issues).
- UI or configuration issues (e.g., adding/removing filter lists not working as expected).

### **Feature Requests**
If you have an idea for improving WebShield, weâ€™d love to hear about it! Please ensure that your request is aligned with the project's goals and current scope (Safari ad-blocking, privacy protection, and performance).

## Before Submitting an Issue

Please complete the following checklist before opening an issue:

- [ ] **Check for duplicates**: Search the [issue tracker](https://github.com/user/webshield/issues) to see if the issue has already been reported or addressed.
- [ ] **Update to the latest version**: Ensure you are using the latest version of WebShield. Issues reported for outdated versions may be closed.
- [ ] **Verify the issue is related to WebShield**: If the issue is specific to a filter list (e.g., ads not being blocked), it should be reported to the list maintainer, not WebShield.

## Where to Report Filter List Issues

Since WebShield does not host or maintain filter lists, please report filter list-related issues directly to the maintainers of those lists.

If the issue is due to an ad-blocking rule not being applied correctly due to a bug in WebShield, feel free to open an issue here and include relevant details.
